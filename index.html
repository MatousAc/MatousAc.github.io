				<h1>Project Description</h1>
				<p> In this project, we focused on creating interactive visualizations for global earthquakes. While some tools for visualization and analysis exist, most geological software is expensive and open visualizations, such as the ‚ÄúLastest Earthquakes‚Äù map on usgs.gov, are limited.</p>
				<p>After obtaining an open dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gustavobmgm/earthquakes-for-ml-prediction">Kaggle</a> we were able to utilize <a href="https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop">Tableau Desktop</a> to create the visualizations above. Some challenges we faced along the way were the proper use of software and the publication of results on the web. However, the availability of the data and the flexibility Tableau offered enabled us to attain the desired results.</p>

				<h1>Understanding and Analyzing the Results</h1>
				<h2>Earthquake Measurements Over Time</h2>
				<p>This visualization displays the different measurement types that are used for a custom magnitude range and time range. One of seismic data's most important features is the magnitude of the quake detected. However, due to the nature of the waves and geographical terrain in various parts of the world and at various altitudes, there is no "one-size-fits-all" method for measuring earthquakes. Rather, there are many methods for converting seismic measurements of S-waves and P-waves into a magnitude for the quake. More details about each type of measurement can be accessed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_magnitude_scales">Wikipedia</a> and the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/magnitude-types">USGS</a> website.</p>
				<p>The first outstanding feature is the spike in earthquake data available in 1973. This increase in data is likely due to various datasets being merged together with different time ranges and more seismic instruments being installed around that time. It is also intriguing that the spike can be solely attributed to the Short-Period Body Wave measurement type.</p>
				<p>Another interesting observation can be seen from filtering the data by magnitude. Try this exercise: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>View the years 1973-2018</li>
					<li>View magnitudes below 4.0</li>
					<li>Now compare the measurement type proportions to magnitudes above 5.0</li>
					<li>You can see a dramatic shift in what measurement types are used for different scales of magnitude.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>From this we can observe that different intensities of earthquakes seem to be measured using different types of seismic waves.</p>
				<h2>Earthquakes Throughout History</h2>
				<p>This map is largely the primary goal of this project. A user can filter data my year, magnitude, and location (by panning and zooming). Most importantly, is is easy to select a specific data point to learn more about an individual earthquake.</p>
				<h2>Earthquake Playback</h2>
				<p>This is a simple visualization that shows earthquakes in a selected year. The data is displayed on a map to provide location and visual magnitude information. The point of this visualization is to be able to observe earthquakes as they occur in history. This functionality is only somewhat effective in Tableau and is still subject to improvement.</p>
				<h2>Measurement Types Worldwide</h2>
				<p>This map is useful to comparing the different methods used for measuring earthquake magnitude. An interesting feature that this visualization displays is that, historically, various regions may favor one method of measurement over another. Try displaying only the years 1970-1990 and magnitudes between 2.5 and 4.5. Observe the various methods clustered along various parts of the North American west coast. Clearly, different geographic locations have used different methods for measuring magnitude even for similarly intense earthquakes.</p>
